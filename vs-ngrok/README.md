## Troubleshooting

### NGROK not found
Make sure NGROK is installed and available in your system PATH. You can verify by running `ngrok version` in your terminal.

### Connection fails
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check that your custom domain is properly configured in NGROK
3. Ensure the local port you're trying to tunnel is not already in use
4. Check NGROK logs in the Output panel

### Custom domain not working
